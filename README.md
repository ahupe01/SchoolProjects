# SchoolProjects
This is a short collection of homeworks and projects 
that I've worked on within the last semester or so that have
taken the most time and effort to accomplish

Also, please excuse the PDF format of the code files. This is how I was asked to hand in
code snippets, homeworks, and projects for many of my classes. This would be the written copy
and we'd present our work to the class live in the software we would use. 

Keeping PDFs of my code with screenshots is just a way to keep a record of everything I have worked on
